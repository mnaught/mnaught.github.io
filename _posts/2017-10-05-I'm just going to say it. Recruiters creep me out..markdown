Here's a story about my first ever experience with headhunters, how I learned to appreciate recruiters and then eventually formed the dour opinion that the entire tech placement industry is fundamentally parasitic and doesn't serve the professionals as much as they say they do.

Actually, that there is the basic thesis of the thing.  
It sounds negative, but it isn't.  
I'm just trying to be realistic about a few things.

But, before I go into that I want to tell you about ...

# The best damn recruiter I ever met.

When I arrived in Oregon, just out of college, job searches were something of a hobby of mine.  

Back then, I'm talking early '90's. The internet was taking root, and had not reached the point where people understood it's potential as a communications medium. 

Anyhow, my job search was a system of 3x5 index cards.  Each week I would get the Oregonian, highlight the jobs ads that looked interesting. Then I'd cut each ad out, pasted it on a card,and then used that as the basis for a mass resume mailing every Sunday.   I filed each card in a little box with dividers by week. When I'd get a response or a call, I'd immediately pull out the card, and mark it up with the details of the progression on the lead.    

When Monster.com launched, I thought it was cute.

It wasn't long until I started receiving calls from staffing agencies.  One in particular stood out.  The company name I forget, and it eventually acquired.  

But the PERSON I met, set the standard in my mind for what a good recruiter acts like.

Let's call him Tom.  (I have to come clean here and admit that I don't remember the guy's name, or his company's name.  I do know the name of the company who bought out his company, but that's not even relevent.)

So, I met with Tom, and he was one of the first to contact me in his small office, and he explained how recruiters work, what I could expect, that there is a signed document and what that means.  He was really plain and thorough.  

The first thing he did was reformat my resume and hand me the orginal word document.  The format he established was much cleaner than what I was using.  I liked it so much that I continued to use the format and the original template for probably fifteen years afterwards.

The next thing he did was, looking back on it, quite remarkable.

He called me when he had an interview lined up for me.  

Next he suggested that we do a mock interview.
So, we did that.  you can google and find any one of a hundred to know what that went like.

Then after that he said, ok, here's something I want you to think about.

First, I want you to go home and list out three things you did on a job or for an employer that you are really proud of or feel really accomplished about.

Then, I want you to get a 3x5 card (you can see why I liked this guy) and write the name of the accomplishment at the top.  So you have three cards.  

Ok.

Next, I want you to list
The situation or circumstances.  i.e the business driver, negating a challange to an operation or goal
The actions you took, the role you played.
The outcome.  

Now, once you have that, carry those around with you, and memorize them.  
practice actually presenting them in that exact format, so you can comment in a meeting,
well, the situation was....
and for those reasons, here are the actions I took, contributing directly to the outcome...
and the result was .... (goal was exceeded, we saved $200,000 )

So, I did that, and before the interview, he called me and said, ok, we'll do the same interview again.  

I have a stopwatch, try to keep your responses to maybe 45s.

And we ran it, and at the end he had some feedback, like the appropriate use of 'um' in the english language and other simplicities like that.   

Where I hit the mark, where I went over time.

## This guy was kind of an anomoly

Looking back on it, no recruiter I've ever worked with has ever done anything like this. 
Actually, I would call this more of a coaching than just "recruiting".

Sure, there are people charging for services like that today, but this guy wasn't.
He was a regular ol' staffing guy.

So the reason I find placement firms so disappointing today is, really because none them take this approach.

## A pecking order

Ok, so the recruitment arrangement in general a percentage brokerage of another person's skill.

In that arrangement, I find that it is most common that in terms of defining the terms, setting the expectations, and making decisions affecting the work arrangement, the weight of importance each party carries in those decisions goes like this:

according to the usual staffing outfits:
1) the client
2) the staffing agency
3) the "resource".  

How the guy I met so many years ago acted:
1) me
2) the client
3) the staffing agency.


## Compare that to this guy

So, a recent interaction I had with a local firm was the exact opposite.  

The guy I spoke to on this one opportunity was maybe three years out of college, marketing of course, and his attitude represented a rare but really annoying when encountered breed of recruiter I call The Gatekeepers.

I went against my better grain and sent a resume to an ad I thought might be a recruiter.  Usually they are easy to spot but this one was intresting enough that I didn't care.

So I get a callback from a guy, the usual, yes go ahead and forward the resume.

During maybe the second discussion I'm having with the guy I mention I've worked with a lot of recruiters.

"What? he says? the only recruiters you should be working with are me and <name of some guy I've never heard of.>"  

So, I forget this guys name.  I'll just call him snotbag.
This kid was cocky.  
I hadn't signed anything.

But I was starting to wonder what I'd be signing.

So, I ask to see the eventual agreement I'd be signing so I can bounce it off of an attorney.
And I do believe snotbag got a little defensive.  

He told me they place tons of people at this company.  
Stressed the salary, the company.  
He never actually addressed my question.

So, the very next day  (we are on day 3 now) I'm working outside with a mitre saw, my phone's inside.
Eventually I see I have like three voicemails from the guy.

When I call him back, he's really irritated with me.
"Is there a reason I can't get ahold of you?" he huffs at me.

"Yeah, I've been working a chopsaw all morning."  

"Well" this didn't seem to be any kind of answer to him. "They want to meet with you"

"You know, I think I'm going to pass on this one."  I said.

I then kicked him and every other recruiter off of my linked in account.
It's time for a new approach.

Guys like this are basic sales agents and they look at the job requisition they are sitting on as a power position, and not a business arrangment benefiting all three parties.

And you know, I would've met them/  But this guy was so much of a cheap Gatekeeper that I wanted nothing to do with his company.  

Again consider the order of importance in this relationship as snotbag presents it:

1) The client, your eventual employer 
2) The gatekeeper's company 
3) the gatekeeper himself
4) me.

Note that there's a bonus layer now. (3)

## So what did Tom understand that nobody else today seems to get?

Tom understood what your automated text analyzing, resume scoring systems and requisition scrubbing snotbags do not capture.

Tom understood that my success was his success.

And so, he did everything he could, and it really wasn't that much, to make sure I would be successful.

It feels like today it's about what I can bring to the recruiter.

The easier presentation for them the better. Can they just forward a nice link?

And never coaching, but then again, I'm old, so, maybe they wouldn't dare.

But I remember the guy who did.
