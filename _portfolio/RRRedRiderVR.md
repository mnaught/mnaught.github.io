Bringing VR to the People.

In February 2018 I was seized with the idea of creating a mobile virtual reality arcade.  The idea was to offer a service that would bring a virtual reality feature to corporate events, parties, classrooms... anywhere.



By April I had setup a new LLC, produced marketing materials, acquired the necessary insurance and licenses, setup domain name and website stuff, secured release copy, commissioned or hacked up graphic art, purchased hardware & software and launched the platform with a booth at Wizard World Portland.  

{% include gallery caption="We were back-to-back busy every day, from show open to show close.  The platform, the layout and the equipment all performed flawlessly." %}

At the show we offered free sessions courtesy of HTC's Ready Player One Arcade program promoting the film with a collection of studio titles provided by HTC, the manufacturer of the Vive headset.  I sent photos to HTC.  They called me from Seattle the next morning and we celebrated how awesome their products are.

We also ran pay-to-play on our licensed libarary of VR content.

While the show was not in any way a financial success, we were busy throughout the show and had many repeat customers.

More importantly, in the entire 3 day show, the platform's subsytems worked flawlessly, supporting the 2-station VR platform by delivering: 

<ul>
<li>Game session management</li>
<li>Payment processing</li>
<li>Guest waitilisting and SMS notification through the Internet.</li>
<li>Electronic Release signature capture.</li>
<li>Wifi and 4g connectivity</li>
</ul>

I continue to market this service and tune the platform.  I am currently writing software to replace some of these 3rd party solutions to save on subscription fees and get best-fit functionality.
