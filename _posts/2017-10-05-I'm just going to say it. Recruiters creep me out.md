Here's a story about my first ever experience with headhunters, how I learned to appreciate recruiters and then eventually formed the dour opinion that the entire tech placement industry is fundamentally parasitic.

Actually, that is the basic premise.  
It sounds negative, but it isn't.  

I'm just trying to be realistic about a few things, looking at it from the perspective of a "human resource."

But, before I go into that I want to tell you about ...

# The best recruiter I ever met.

When I arrived in Oregon, just out of college, job searches were something of a hobby of mine.  

My job search was a system of 3x5 index cards.  Each week I would get the Sunday newspaper and highlight all the jobs ads that looked interesting. 

Then, I'd cut each ad out and paste it on a card.
I'd use that for a mass resume mailing every Sunday.   
It involved a lot of printing, signing and stamping envelopes. 

After I filed each card in a little box with dividers by week. When I'd get a response or a call, I'd immediately pull out the card, and mark it up with the details of the progression on the lead.    

( When Monster.com launched, I thought it was cute. And it was a welcome relief!)

It wasn't long until I started receiving calls from staffing agencies. 

One in particular stood out, and set the standard in my mind for what a good recruiter acts like.

Let's call him Tom.

Tom was one of the first to contact me.  When we met he explained how recruiters work, what I could expect, that there is a signed document and what that means.  He was really plain and thorough.  

The first thing he did was rework my resume and hand me the orginal word document.  The format he established was much cleaner than what I was using.  I liked it so much that I continued to use the format and the original template for probably fifteen years afterwards.  

He called me when he had an interview lined up for me.  
We did a practice interview, hitting points he knew the client would be asking.

Then he said,"Ok, here's something I want you to think about."

First, I want you to go home and list out three things you did on a job or for an employer that you are really proud of or feel really accomplished about.

Then, I want you to get a 3x5 card (you can see why I liked this guy) and write the name of each accomplishment at the top.  So you have three cards.  

Ok.

Next, on each card I want you to list:
* The situation or circumstances
    (i.e.: What was the business driver, negating a challange to an operation or goal?)
* The actions you took, the role you played 
* What the outcome was

Now, carry those cards around with you, and memorize them.  
Practice actually talking about those points in that exact format.

The situation was....
and for those reasons, here are the actions I took, contributing directly to the outcome...
and the result was .... (i.e., the goal was exceeded, we 
saved $200,000 )

So, I did exactly that, and before the interview, he called me and said, ok, we'll do the same interview again.  

I have a stopwatch, try to keep your responses to maybe 45s.
And we ran through it.

## Tom was kind of an anomoly

Looking back on it, no recruiter I've ever worked with has ever done anything like this. 

Actually, I would call this more coaching than just "recruiting".

There are people charging for services like that today, but this guy wasn't.  He was a regular ol' staffing guy.   But he recognized I was new to job hunting, and went the extra mile.

The reason I find placement firms so disappointing today is, really because none them seem to operate from this basic mindset: it's a double sell.  Recruiters have two clients.

## A pecking order

Ok, so the recruitment business operates, in general, by taking a percentage brokerage of another person's skill.  

It's usually direct bill to the client, and a check cut to you.  

The value proposition for the CLIENT (not the "human resource") is that recruiting 
takes time. Screening candidates takes time.  Background checking takes time.  

Making sure the recruiting and hiring process is compliant with complex employment 
laws takes dilligence and time..

Again, the job takes a lot of work.

For the "resource" (that's us), this arrangment has pros and cons.

PROS:

* Convenient leads on jobs
* Good selection of prospects
* Someone else does the legwork handling the presentation and communications with the client

CONS:
 * Most of the time, the "resource" has very little latitude to define the terms of the arrangement. 

 The three parties, the client, the recruiter and "the resource" carry different weight in those decisions, and the order goes like this:

1) the client
2) the staffing agency
3) the "resource".  

Tom, the best recruiter I ever met, acted as if the order was:
1) me
2) the client
3) the staffing agency

Now, obviously Tom's business operates on agreements with his clients.  

So, the first list is legit in Tom's world.

But, even though I'm aware of that reality, it sure didn't seem that way.

## Compare Tom to this guy

So, a recent interaction I had with a local firm was the exact opposite experience.  

The guy I spoke to on this one opportunity was maybe three years out of college 
and he was definately giving that marketing degree it's run for it's money.  

Recruiters like this one are rare, but really annoying.  
I call these folks "The Gatekeepers."

I get a callback from a guy, the usual, yes go ahead and forward the resume.

During maybe the second discussion I'm having with the guy I mention I've worked with a lot of recruiters.

"What? he says? the only recruiters you should be working with are me and (name of some guy I've never heard of.)"  

Full Stop.  That's neither appropriate or respectful thing for one human to say to 
another human being, especially in a business context.

I hadn't signed anything.

I forget this guys name.  
I'll just call him snotbag.

I was starting to wonder what I'd be signing.

So, I ask to see the eventual agreement I'd be signing so I can bounce it off of an attorney.

And I do believe snotbag got a little defensive.  

He told me they place tons of people at this company.  
He stressed the salary, the company.  
He never actually addressed my question.

So, the very next day (We are on day 3 now.  Good sales guys move fast!)

I'm outside, working on a project with a mitre saw, and my phone's left inside.
But, eventually I see I have like three voicemails from the guy.

When I call him back, he's really irritated with me.
"Is there a reason I can't get ahold of you?" he huffs at me.

"Yeah, I've been working a chopsaw all morning."  

"Well" this didn't seem to be any kind of answer to him. "They want to meet with you"

Deep breath.

"You know, I think I'm going to pass on this one."  

I then kicked him and every other recruiter off of my linked in account.
It's time for a new approach.


### Staffing is haaaard.

Most folks I've worked with have a level perspective, and understand that staffing as 
a business is a 2-way sales job.

Sell the candidate on the project or company.
Sell the client on the candidate.

It is not an easy job.  I get that.

But guess what?  Neither is mine.  And like most professionals, I've worked pretty hard to become a commodity.

But occasionally, I meet someone who looks at the job requisition they are sitting on as a power position.   

And in that perspective, I may as well be a new car the guy's trying to sell.

And that model seems very, very off to me and to anyone with any experience or self respect.

I would've met with this guy's client.

But my interactions with the middleman were enough to sell me that I wanted nothing to do with his company.  

Again, consider the order of importance in this relationship as snotbag presents it:

1) The client 
2) The gatekeeper's company 
3) the gatekeeper himself
4) me.

Note that there's a bonus layer now. (3)

## So what did Tom understand that nobody else today seems to get?

Tom understood that my success was his success to make sure I would be successful throughout the process.

It feels like today it's about "What I can bring to the recruiter?"
The easier you can make the presentation for them the better. 
Can they just forward a nice link?

And don't expect coaching, skills development or resume advice. 
Then again, I'm old, so, maybe they wouldn't dare.

But I remember the guy who did.
