First consults are free.  I'd love to hear what's vexing your business, unit or operation and envision an impacting solution with you.

<div>
PLEASE READ BEFORE CONTACTING ME ABOUT A PROJECT<br><br>

 Occasionally I am approached by someone with a hot business idea and "they just need a tech-head to make it happen" or some variant of that.  <br><br>
 
 I call these people geniuses, and a few of them actually are.  <br><br>

Experience warns me, however, about entering into "equity" arrangements instead of solid compensation.  <br>  <br>

Not that I don't get excited about the potential of new ideas and opportunities, but if you have a venture in mind and you'd like my involvement on some equity share basis, please have a business plan available.
